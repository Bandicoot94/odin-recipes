        <h3>Total Time: 1 hr</h3>
        <h3>Yield: 8 servings</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups balsamic vinegar</li>
            <li>3 tomatoes</li>
            <li>12 oz fresh mozzarella, thickly sliced</li>
            <li>Large bunch fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Pinch kosher salt</li>
            <li>Pinch ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure the balsamic vinegar and pour into a saucepan. Bring it to a gentle boil over a low heat. Cook it until the balsamic vinegar has reduced to a nice thick glaze (but still pourable), about 15 minutes. Oh and one other thing, your house will stink. But it's a good kind of stink, it's a vinegary stink. Allow the reduction to cool to room temperature before you serve it.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to assemble the salad, cut the tomatoes into thick slices. Arrange them on a platter, alternating them with the mozzarella slices. Tuck the whole basil leaves in between the tomato and cheese slices.</li>
            <li>Drizzle on the gorgeous, almost black balsamic reduction. Then drizzle olive oil in a thin stream over the top. Finally, sprinkle on salt and pepper. </li>
        </ol>
